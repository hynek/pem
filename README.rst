*pem* is an MIT_-licensed Python module for parsing and splitting of `PEM files`_, i.e. Base64-encoded DER keys and certificates.

It runs on Python 3.7+, has no dependencies, and does not attempt to interpret the certificate data in any way.

Itâ€™s born from the need to load keys, certificates, trust chains, and DH parameters from various certificate deployments: some servers (like Apache_) expect them to be a separate file, others (like nginx_) expect them concatenated to the server certificate and finally some (like HAProxy_) expect key, certificate, and chain to be in one file.
With *pem*, your Python application can cope with all of those scenarios:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import pem
   >>> certs = pem.parse_file("chain.pem")
   >>> certs
   [<Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>, <Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>]
   >>> str(certs[0])
   '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...'

Additionally to the vanilla parsing code, *pem* also contains helpers for Twisted_ that save a lot of boilerplate code.

*pem* is available from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pem/>`_, its documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://pem.readthedocs.io/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hynek/pem>`_.
