<!-- teaser-begin -->

*pem* is a Python module for parsing and splitting of [PEM files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_filename_extensions), i.e. Base64-encoded DER keys and certificates.

It has no dependencies and does not attempt to interpret the certificate data in any way.

It’s born from the need to load keys, certificates, trust chains, and Diffie–Hellman parameters from various certificate deployments:
some servers (like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)) expect them to be a separate file, others (like [nginx](https://nginx.org/)) expect them concatenated to the server certificate and finally some (like [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)) expect key, certificate, and chain to be in one file.
With *pem*, your Python application can cope with all of those scenarios:

```pycon
>>> import pem
>>> certs = pem.parse_file("chain.pem")
>>> certs
[<Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>, <Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>]
>>> str(certs[0])
'-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...'
```

Additionally to the vanilla parsing code, *pem* also contains helpers for [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.ssl.Certificate.html#loadPEM) that save a lot of boilerplate code.
